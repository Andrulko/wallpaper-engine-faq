# "DirectX 10을 지원하지 않습니다" 작동 중단
인터넷에서 정확한 그래픽 카드 이름을 검색해서, 해당 그래픽 카드가 DirectX 10을 지원하는지 확인하세요. If you have an old card, installing DirectX 10 will not fix this problem if your graphics card does not support DirectX 10 on hardware level.

If your card does support it and you get this error, then try reinstalling the latest driver (or an older, more stable driver). Remove intrusive security software from the PC that could prevent Wallpaper Engine from accessing your graphics card.

## Duet Display and other display extension software
Display extension software like Duet Display installs a fake graphics card which is not capable of the same features as a real graphics card. This can also be the cause for Wallpaper Engine to show this error as Wallpaper Engine requires a real graphics card with DirectX 10 support. Display extension software like DuetDisplay is not compatible with Wallpaper Engine and must be turned off.
