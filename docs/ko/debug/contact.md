Wallpaper Engine 관련 기술적 문제가 발생하면, 우선 FAQ를 확인해 해결해 보세요. Most technical support tickets we received can be fixed with the FAQ.

You can also ask or search on our Steam Discussion board, we generally try to answer everyone and most questions have been discussed there before:

If you cannot find a fitting article or cannot fix your problem, you can reach us at [support@wallpaperengine.io](mailto:support@wallpaperengine.io?subject=Support%20Request).

::: tip If you are having a technical issue, it helps if you include a log file from our scan tool:
