# Windows N: mfplat.dll eksik

Windows N'de medya özellikleri bulunmaz! Windows sürümünüz ve derleme numaranız için doğru Medya Özellik Paketi'ni yüklemelisiniz:

* Windows 10:
  * [Medya Özellik Paketi indirme](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack) (sayfa, Microsoft tarafından sadece İngilizce mevcuttur)

* Windows 7:
  * [Media Feature Pack Download](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=16546)

**Make sure to install the x64 and x86 version.**

If it still shows the same error then **you have installed the wrong version**, try installing the correct version and restarting the PC. Should nothing work and it is still missing, your system files are probably defective, try restoring the system to an earlier state or reinstall Windows.

:::warning Please note Every time Microsoft releases a major update to Windows 10, you must install the media feature pack again. If this undesirable for you, consider switching to a normal version of Windows as the other versions are always shipped with these features!

**The whole point of Windows N is that it does not have media features. So if this is not what you want, you should not use Windows N.** :::
