# 從搜尋結果中排除特定桌布

務必使用應用程式的「工作坊」分頁來搜尋新的桌布。 Steam 工作坊網站不具備與此應用程式相同的篩選功能，也會顯示過多您不感興趣的內容。

## 排除特定類型 (例如動漫)

您可從應用程式篩選掉您不喜歡的類別。 開啟 Wallpaper Engine 的「工作坊」分頁，點選左上角的「篩選結果」按鈕，啟用過濾器側欄。 取消選取所有您不希望在結果中看到的所有類別。

如果不想看到動漫桌布，請移除*動漫*和 *MMD (Miku-Miku-Dance)* 類別。 此外，您也可能希望移除*卡通*和*女生*類別，因為這些包含動畫內容，您可能還會篩選掉其他內容。

## 排除特定年齡分級

Steam 工作坊允許一定程度的成人內容，例如裸體。 If you do not want to see this kind of content, only enable the "Everyone" age rating in the filters:

Most content is tagged correctly and this will filter out the large majority of mature content. If you still come across adult content which has been rated for "Everyone", please use the report functionality in the app. The content will be re-classified or banned after a review.

## Reporting rule-breaking content

We and the Steam administrators / moderators remove wallpapers breaking the rules on a daily basis. Please report Workshop submissions that break the guidelines to help us find them.

The Workshop allows users to publicize works without us being able to check them prior to them being visible, this is how the Steam Workshop works and not something we can change. We can only remove submissions after they have been uploaded. If this is a problem for you, make sure to enable the *Approved* tag in the filter settings as these are hand-picked and manually-checked wallpapers. Be sure to read the sections above on how to configure your filter settings so that you can simply remove certain types of content that you do not wish to see.
