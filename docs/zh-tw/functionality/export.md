# 將桌布匯出為 GIF/視訊

在 Wallpaper Engine 編輯器製作的桌布，比較像是電腦遊戲的關卡，不像是視訊檔案。 這些桌布沒有定義明確的開始或結束，而且包含隨機元素。 正如您無法將電腦遊戲匯出為視訊檔案，您也無法將桌布匯出為視訊或 GIF。

However, you can create a recording of your wallpapers and manually try to create a perfect loop if the elements in your wallpaper allow for that. For this purpose, we recommend free tools like *ScreenToGif* or *OBS Studio*:

* [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) (Easy to use)

* [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) (More advanced features)

#### Getting a clear shot of your wallpapers

You can easily get a clear view at your wallpaper and resize it by right-clicking it in the "Installed" tab and then clicking on "Play in Window", which will open a window with your wallpaper in it. This eliminates the need to hide your desktop icons and other Windows elements and allows you to resize the window to get the size and aspect ratio you want for your "export":
