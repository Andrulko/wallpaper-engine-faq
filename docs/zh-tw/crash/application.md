## Wallpaper Engine 損毀快速修復方式

如果不確定導致 Wallpaper Engine 損毀的原因，請將顯示卡驅動程式全新重新安裝。 亦即，您需要先解除安裝驅動程式，等現有的驅動程式完全解除安裝後，再重新安裝最新的驅動程式。 有一些驅動程式在進階區段中提供了「執行全新重新安裝」的選項，請啟用此選項，自動清除不完整驅動程式遺留的任何檔案。 您可以從以下大廠取得最新的顯示卡驅動程式：

* [Nvidia GeForce](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
* [AMD Radeon](https://www.amd.com/support)
* [Intel Graphics](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers)

如果您安裝了防毒應用程式 (Windows Defender 除外)，請務必在 Wallpaper Engine 的防毒設定中設定為例外。 如果防毒軟體永久損壞或鎖定某些檔案，則有時候必須重新安裝 Wallpaper Engine。

此外，務必透過 Steam 驗證 Wallpaper Engine，確保其完好未損壞。

This crash usually happens due to an issue in Windows itself. Try to re-install the latest version of your sound card drivers as this may fix the problem. You can also fix these crashes by changing the *Other application playing audio* option in the *Performance* tab of the Wallpaper Engine settings to *Keep running*.

### atiumdag.dll / atiumd64.dll

* [AMD Radeon](https://www.amd.com/support)

::: tip Please note Make sure to select the "Perform clean re-installation" checkbox during setup or manually uninstall your current drivers first. If your current drivers are broken, it's important to fully clear them first. :::

### nvwgf2umx.dll

The Nvidia drivers on your system are crashing. Go to the Nvidia website, download the latest drivers from there and install them:

* [Nvidia GeForce](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

::: tip Please note Make sure to select the "Perform clean re-installation" checkbox during setup or manually uninstall your current drivers first. If your current drivers are broken, it's important to fully clear them first. :::

### igdumd64.dll / igd10umd64.dll / igdumdx32.dll / igd10umd32.dll

* [Intel Graphics](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers)


### MMDEvAPI.dll

This type of crash occurs to due broken audio software installed on your system. This is usually caused by "sound enhancement" software, especially the ones pre-installed on various notebooks. This type of software will often cause crashes because they interact with Windows in a buggy way, try and look for "Sonic Studio" or "Nahimic" and update them. If you cannot find an update for these programs, you can also uninstall them as they are not necessary for your computer audio to function properly.

### fraps32.dll

The crash has been caused by the FPS monitor and screen recording app Fraps. Fraps has not received updates since 2013 and is a heavily outdated application. Please use an alternative to Fraps as this is a Fraps bug which may never be fixed as the software is abandoned.

## Crash error 0xc000007b

This means that a Windows module has been corrupted by something on your system - usually DirectX itself is broken in this case. Try manually deleting these files:

* C:\Windows\SysWOW64\d3dx9_43.dll
* C:\Windows\System32\d3dx9_43.dll

Now install them again with the DirectX 9 installer: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\wallpaper_engine\_CommonRedist\DirectX\Jun2010\dxsetup.exe* (The exact location depends on where your wallpaper_engine installation directory is).

If you still get this error it might be another, similar DirectX module that has been broken by something. This usually indicates a bigger underlying issues with your Windows installation which you need to fix before you can run Wallpaper Engine.

## Crashing after Hibernation / Sleep

If Wallpaper Engine crashes after Windows hibernation, then Windows is failing to correctly restore your graphics card drivers and Wallpaper Engine together. Hibernation in Windows is simply not a reliable process. You can enable the option **Safe start after hibernation** in Wallpaper Engine to mitigate this issue. This option will attempt to automatically restart Wallpaper Engine instead of expecting Windows to correctly work after hibernation.
