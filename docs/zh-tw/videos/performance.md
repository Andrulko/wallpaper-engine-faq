# 視訊凍結 / 間斷 / 效能不佳

這個問題可能源自硬體效能不足，無法正確顯示特定視訊。 視訊桌布無法與標準的視訊播放器相比，必須以圖示組成，可能還有多個畫面自動縮放。 按照預設，視訊桌布也會使用 GPU 的視訊解碼器將 CPU 使用率降至最低。

## 背景錄製勾點
It could also come from any kind of driver features to record applications like ReLive, Shadow Play/Nvidia Share or Windows GameDVR. Try disabling them and see if it makes a difference, then exclude Wallpaper Engine from them. Also make sure no other recording/overlay programs load themselves into Wallpaper Engine and slow down rendering.

You can try to use our scan tool to determine if any programs with know recording hooks are installed but it does not catch everything, especially common recording hooks like the ones coming with Nvidia GeForce Experience:

## Dynamic Super Resolution (DSR) / GPU Scaling
Driver level hacks like GPU Scaling/DSR could cause issues as well, try disabling them and if that helps, disable them for Wallpaper Engine specifically.

## Bad performance in dwm.exe in systems with multiple GPUs / multiple screens
If you have enabled the integrated GPU on your desktop PC in the BIOS although a dedicated graphics card is installed, you can experience bad performance and high CPU usage of DWM.exe. If possible, do not enable your integrated GPU. **It's very important to plug all your monitors into your dedicated graphics card.** Using both GPUs at the same time will break hardware acceleration of the desktop window manager. Without Nvidia Optimus technology or similar, Windows will be forced to copy the wallpaper image from one GPU to the other - a slow operation. In fact any shared action between your GPUs will suffer from this, it is the same as moving a game window right between both monitors.

This specific issue does not affect hardware built for multi-GPU setups like laptops with Nvidia Optimus or proper Nvidia SLI / AMD Crossfire setups with a hardware bridge.
