紅線來自 AMD 顯示卡驅動程式。 請停用「示範模式」以移除紅線。 這個選項可能位於不同位置，取決於顯示卡驅動程式的版本。 Look through all AMD graphics card settings, you should find it somewhere. If you are unable to locate it, you can also fix this problem by doing a clean re-installation of your graphics card drivers.

Download the latest drivers for your graphics card from the AMD website:
