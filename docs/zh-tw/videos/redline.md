# 畫面出現紅線

紅線來自 AMD 顯示卡驅動程式。 請停用「示範模式」以移除紅線。 The option may be in different places depending on the version of your graphics card drivers. Look through all AMD graphics card settings, you should find it somewhere. If you are unable to locate it, you can also fix this problem by doing a clean re-installation of your graphics card drivers.

Download the latest drivers for your graphics card from the AMD website:

Then uninstall your current drivers first, it is very important that you first uninstall them and clear all existing settings if asked. Afterwards, you can install the drivers you have just downloaded.
