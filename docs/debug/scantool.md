# Use the Wallpaper Engine scan tool to create a debug log
TODO
* Make sure Wallpaper Engine is running.
* Choose the [url=https://i.imgur.com/EQbffb7.png]4th launch option[/url] in Steam (Scan for conflicting applications).
* Click on [url=https://i.imgur.com/UFyDC7a.png]Save Full Log[/url] and save it on your desktop.
* Open www.pastebin.com and paste the contents of the log file there and [url=https://i.imgur.com/LCO26DH.png]upload it[/url].
* Share the link to the paste. Even when no conflict was found, the tool is not capable of finding all conflicts and we are often able to determine computer issues by looking at the log output.
