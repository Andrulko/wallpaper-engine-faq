# Windows N：mfplat.dll 丢失

Windows N 不具备媒体功能！ 您需要针对特定的 Windows 版本和内部版本号，安装正确的媒体功能包：

* Windows 10：
  * [媒体功能包下载](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack)（Microsoft 仅提供英语版页面）

* Windows 7：
  * [媒体功能包下载](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=16546)

**确保安装 x64 和 x86 版本。**

如果仍然显示相同的错误，则说明**您安装了错误的版本**，请尝试安装正确的版本，并重新启动 PC。 Should nothing work and it is still missing, your system files are probably defective, try restoring the system to an earlier state or reinstall Windows.

:::warning Please note Every time Microsoft releases a major update to Windows 10, you must install the media feature pack again. If this undesirable for you, consider switching to a normal version of Windows as the other versions are always shipped with these features!

**The whole point of Windows N is that it does not have media features. So if this is not what you want, you should not use Windows N.** :::
