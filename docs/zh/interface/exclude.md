# 从搜索中排除某些壁纸

始终使用应用程序中的“创意工坊”选项卡搜索新壁纸。 Steam 创意工坊网站不具备与该应用程序相同的筛选功能，而且会显示过多您不感兴趣的内容。

## 排除某些样式（例如动漫）

您可以从应用程序中筛选掉您不喜欢的类别。 打开 Wallpaper Engine 中的“创意工坊”选项卡，然后通过单击左上角的“筛选结果”按钮启用筛选器侧栏。 取消选择您不希望在结果中看到的所有类别。

如果不想看到动漫壁纸，请移除*动漫*和*MMD (Miku-Miku-Dance)* 类别。 Additionally, you may also want to remove *Cartoon* and *Girls* as they also contain some anime but you are more likely to filter out other content as well.

## Excluding certain age ratings

The Steam Workshop permits a certain degree of adult content, such as nudity. If you do not want to see this kind of content, only enable the "Everyone" age rating in the filters:

Most content is tagged correctly and this will filter out the large majority of mature content. If you still come across adult content which has been rated for "Everyone", please use the report functionality in the app. The content will be re-classified or banned after a review.

## Reporting rule-breaking content

We and the Steam administrators / moderators remove wallpapers breaking the rules on a daily basis. Please report Workshop submissions that break the guidelines to help us find them.

The Workshop allows users to publicize works without us being able to check them prior to them being visible, this is how the Steam Workshop works and not something we can change. We can only remove submissions after they have been uploaded. If this is a problem for you, make sure to enable the *Approved* tag in the filter settings as these are hand-picked and manually-checked wallpapers. Be sure to read the sections above on how to configure your filter settings so that you can simply remove certain types of content that you do not wish to see.
