如果看不到除已安装壁纸以外的壁纸的预览图像，则有防火墙或安全软件阻止浏览器访问 Internet。 您必须禁用该防火墙或安全软件，或者为“ui32.exe”添加例外。

预览图像是从 Steam 服务器直接下载的图像。 如果无法加载预览图像，则说明 Wallpaper Engine 和 Steam 服务器之间的连接受阻。 Some users had these blocks in their network router, you can test if this is an issue in your router or on your computer by testing if the preview images start showing up when your computer is connected to a wi-fi hotspot from your smartphone.

Some users of *accelerator software* also have issues with image previews being loaded. Make sure any type of network acceleration software is not blocking Wallpaper Engine from downloading image files in the background.
