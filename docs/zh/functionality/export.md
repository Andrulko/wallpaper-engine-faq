# 将壁纸导出为 GIF/视频

在 Wallpaper Engine 编辑器中制作的壁纸，更像是计算机游戏中的关卡而非视频文件。 它们没有明确定义的开始或结束，而且包含随机性元素。 就像您无法将计算机游戏导出为视频文件一样，您同样无法将壁纸导出为视频或 GIF。

However, you can create a recording of your wallpapers and manually try to create a perfect loop if the elements in your wallpaper allow for that. For this purpose, we recommend free tools like *ScreenToGif* or *OBS Studio*:

* [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) (Easy to use)

* [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) (More advanced features)

#### Getting a clear shot of your wallpapers

You can easily get a clear view at your wallpaper and resize it by right-clicking it in the "Installed" tab and then clicking on "Play in Window", which will open a window with your wallpaper in it. This eliminates the need to hide your desktop icons and other Windows elements and allows you to resize the window to get the size and aspect ratio you want for your "export":
