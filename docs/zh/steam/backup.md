# 备份 Steam 创意工坊

如果您出于任何原因从 Steam 中删除了壁纸，Steam 也会从您的 PC 上删除这些壁纸。 Wallpaper Engine 无法阻止这种情况，但如果您对此感到担忧，您可以备份壁纸。

与此类似，许多人报告称，Steam 会随机决定重新下载所有创意工坊文件，如果您的数据量非常庞大，这可能很令人烦恼。 Creating a backup and severing all ties to Steam can avoid that if it happens too often.

# Creating a Backup

The following guide expects that your Steam and Wallpaper Engine are installed in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\`, if you have installed your Steam / Wallpaper Engine somewhere else, be sure to check in those locations.

1. Locate the folder in which Steam stores your wallpapers, by default it is in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\431960` ::: tip **431960** is the Steam ID of Wallpaper Engine, Steam uses this directory for all Wallpaper Engine downloads. :::
2. Copy the folder 431960 to Wallpaper Engine's installation path here: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\wallpaper_engine\projects\431960`
3. **Rename** the folder `431960` into `backup` so that the complete path looks like this: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\wallpaper_engine\projects\backup`
4. The `backup` directory now includes all your previously downloaded wallpapers, each in their own sub-directory (the numbers represent the Steam Workshop ID of the wallpaper)
5. Restart the wallpaper browser and you should see the backed up wallpapers now. You can now unsubscribe the duplicate Steam ones and only use your personal copy of them

::: warning Do **not** manually delete the Steam Workshop folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\431960`. This will cause your Steam to be confused and re-download all wallpapers. Simply unsubscribe from your wallpapers and let Steam delete the duplicate files itself. :::
