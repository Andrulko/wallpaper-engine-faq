# Steamworks 不可用

Wallpaper Engine 和 Steam 出于某些原因无法通信。 重新启动 Steam，然后重新启动 Wallpaper Engine。 请确保登录到您拥有 Wallpaper Engine 的帐户。 如果您以管理员身份运行 Steam 或 Wallpaper Engine，Wallpaper Engine 中的 Steamworks SDK 可能无法正常工作。 The solution is to not run either program as admin, which is the intended way. If it still does not work, reinstall Steam and get rid of any antivirus that blocks communication between different programs.

Try the following steps:

* Restart Steam, then Wallpaper Engine.
* Make sure you are logged into the Steam account that owns Wallpaper Engine.
* Do **not** run Steam or Wallpaper Engine as administrator.
* Exclude the Steam directory from your antivirus or completely disable any third-party antivirus application
* Close "Steam idling" programs.
* Delete cracked Steam games that override Steam's presence on the PC.
* Uninstall Wallpaper Engine and Steam. Delete the entire Steam folder. Reinstall Steam and Wallpaper Engine.
