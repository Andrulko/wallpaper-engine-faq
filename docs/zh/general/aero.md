# Windows 7：无法启用 Aero

Aero 是 Windows 的一项功能，也是使用 Wallpaper Engine 的最低系统要求 — 如果将其禁用，则无法使用动态壁纸。 如果无法自动启用该功能，则说明您的系统存在问题，或者未达到在 Windows 7 上启用 Aero 的最低硬件要求。

Windows Aero is responsible for the transparent effect on the task bar ar the top row of windows. If your task bar is not transparent (and has a light blue color), Aero is disabled. You can enable Aero in the Windows 7 theme settings. Your Windows 7 should look like this after enabling and Aero theme (notice the transparent task bar and start menu):

If your hardware supports Windows Aero but you cannot enable it, **it usually means your graphics card drivers are broken**. Download the latest graphics card drivers for Windows 7 and try again.

::: tip **We recommend using Windows 10** because this problem only exists Windows 7. Windows 7 is not receiving any more updates and most hardware manufacturers have abandoned support for it. This can lead to issues with hardware drivers which cause Aero to be broken. :::
