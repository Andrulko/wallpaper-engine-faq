# 分辨率不同的显示器的壁纸居中

如果您选择在分辨率不同的多台显示器上显示单一壁纸，那么该操作将根据您正在使用的分辨率而非显示器的物理大小来执行。 Windows 不考虑物理大小，仅与以像素为单位的大小相关。

Imagine you would center a single, normal window like Steam between your monitors. You cannot scale one side up or down without affecting the other monitor. This is exactly how a wallpaper works too. Live wallpapers are not static images, so they cannot be cut up and stitched together continuously like it would be possible with an image.

Take a screenshot of your entire desktop in Windows or through Wallpaper Engine and examine it, you will see that the wallpaper is centered according to that, the resolution of your monitors controls the center.
