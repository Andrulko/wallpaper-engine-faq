## Wallpaper Engine 崩溃快速修复尝试

如果不确定导致 Wallpaper Engine 崩溃的原因，请全新安装显卡驱动程序。 这意味着，您需要先完全卸载当前的驱动程序，然后再重新安装最新的驱动程序。 有些驱动程序在“高级”部分提供“执行全新安装”的选项，请务必启用该选项，以自动清除损坏驱动程序的所有残留项。 您可以从以下所有大型供应商处获得最新的显卡驱动程序：

* [Nvidia GeForce](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
* [AMD Radeon](https://www.amd.com/support)
* [Intel Graphics](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers)

If you have an antivirus application installed (except Windows Defender), make sure to set up an exception for Wallpaper Engine in your antivirus settings. Sometimes a re-installation of Wallpaper Engine is necessary after this if your antivirus has permanently broken or locked some files.

Always also try to verify the Wallpaper Engine files through steam to ensure they are not broken:

### AudioSes.dll

This crash usually happens due to an issue in Windows itself. Try to re-install the latest version of your sound card drivers as this may fix the problem. You can also fix these crashes by changing the *Other application playing audio* option in the *Performance* tab of the Wallpaper Engine settings to *Keep running*.

### atiumdag.dll / atiumd64.dll

* [AMD Radeon](https://www.amd.com/support)

::: tip Please note Make sure to select the "Perform clean re-installation" checkbox during setup or manually uninstall your current drivers first. If your current drivers are broken, it's important to fully clear them first. :::

### nvwgf2umx.dll

The Nvidia drivers on your system are crashing. Go to the Nvidia website, download the latest drivers from there and install them:

* [Nvidia GeForce](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

::: tip Please note Make sure to select the "Perform clean re-installation" checkbox during setup or manually uninstall your current drivers first. If your current drivers are broken, it's important to fully clear them first. :::

### igdumd64.dll / igd10umd64.dll / igdumdx32.dll / igd10umd32.dll

The Intel graphics drivers on your system are crashing. Go to the Intel website, download the latest drivers from there and install them:

* [Intel Graphics](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers)


### MMDEvAPI.dll

This type of crash occurs to due broken audio software installed on your system. This is usually caused by "sound enhancement" software, especially the ones pre-installed on various notebooks. This type of software will often cause crashes because they interact with Windows in a buggy way, try and look for "Sonic Studio" or "Nahimic" and update them. If you cannot find an update for these programs, you can also uninstall them as they are not necessary for your computer audio to function properly.

### fraps32.dll

The crash has been caused by the FPS monitor and screen recording app Fraps. Fraps has not received updates since 2013 and is a heavily outdated application. Please use an alternative to Fraps as this is a Fraps bug which may never be fixed as the software is abandoned.

## Crash error 0xc000007b

This means that a Windows module has been corrupted by something on your system - usually DirectX itself is broken in this case. Try manually deleting these files:

* C:\Windows\SysWOW64\d3dx9_43.dll
* C:\Windows\System32\d3dx9_43.dll

Now install them again with the DirectX 9 installer: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\wallpaper_engine\_CommonRedist\DirectX\Jun2010\dxsetup.exe* (The exact location depends on where your wallpaper_engine installation directory is).

If you still get this error it might be another, similar DirectX module that has been broken by something. This usually indicates a bigger underlying issues with your Windows installation which you need to fix before you can run Wallpaper Engine.

## Crashing after Hibernation / Sleep

If Wallpaper Engine crashes after Windows hibernation, then Windows is failing to correctly restore your graphics card drivers and Wallpaper Engine together. Hibernation in Windows is simply not a reliable process. You can enable the option **Safe start after hibernation** in Wallpaper Engine to mitigate this issue. This option will attempt to automatically restart Wallpaper Engine instead of expecting Windows to correctly work after hibernation.
