Wallpaper Engine uses hardware acceleration for videos for optimal performance unlike most video players. This means that your graphics card drivers may influence the way videos look.

You need to reset the video options in your graphics control panel for your Nvidia/AMD/Intel graphics card to fix this.

If you have a laptop, make sure to reset it for all of them.

You can also reinstall the driver and choose to reset all settings ("clean re-installation") to do this, this is possible with Nvidia's drivers, for example. If your drivers do not offer you to perform a clean re-installation, first uninstall your old drivers and then install the new graphics card drivers. 

If you are uncertain what to do: Download the latest drivers for your graphics card, then use DDU to uninstall your graphics card drivers and delete all settings:

Afterwards, install the drivers you have just downloaded, this will definitely fix the problem.
