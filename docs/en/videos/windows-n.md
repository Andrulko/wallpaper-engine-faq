# Windows N / mfplat.dll missing 

Windows N does not come with media features! You need to install the correct Media Feature Pack for your specific Windows version and build number: 

* Windows 10:
  * https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack (page only provided in English by Microsoft)

* Windows 7:
  * https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=16546

Make sure to install the x64 and x86 version.

If it still shows the same error then **you have installed the wrong one**, try installing the correct version and restarting the PC. Should nothing work and it's still missing, your system files are probably defective, try restoring the system to an earlier state or reinstall Windows.

[h1]REGARDING WINDOWS 10 UPDATES[/h1]
Every time Microsoft releases a major update to Windows 10, you must install the media feature pack again. If this undesirable for you, consider switching to a normal version of Windows, as the other versions are always shipped with these features!

The whole point of Windows N is that it doesn't have media features. So if this is not what you want, you should not use Windows N.
