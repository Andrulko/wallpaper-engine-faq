# Wallpaper Engine en Linux, Mac o Android

Wallpaper Engine solo está disponible en Windows, y no tenemos planes previstos para llevar la compatibilidad a otras plataformas.

A pesar de que entendemos que los usuarios quieran que sea compatible con más sistemas operativos, no es una tarea sencilla. En esencia, Wallpaper Engine es un programa completamente personalizado y la cantidad de trabajo necesaria para hacerlo compatible con otras plataformas es titánica.

Algunos usuarios se preguntarán cómo es posible que sea tan fácil hacer que algunos juegos y aplicaciones sean compatibles con Mac y Linux. La respuesta es sencilla: son programas basados en motores como Unity o Unreal Engine, que no necesitan que los desarrolladores hagan nada sustancial para hacerlos compatibles con otras plataformas. However, none of this applies when it comes to an end-user application like Wallpaper Engine - since it's an application which interacts closely with the operating system, it really needs to be tailored to each specific operating system to make it work properly. In the case of Linux, it goes even further and must be made to work with every popular display manager which differ significantly between distributions and partially even between releases of distributions.

While all of this would in theory be possible, the simple truth is that it's not economically viable to add support for Linux or Mac OS at this point. If you take a look at the [Steam hardware survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey), you can see that less than 1% of Steam users use Linux. And again, this is split up even further into different distributions of Linux, mostly Ubuntu which comes in at a mere 0.25% of users.

As explained above, the time needed to port Wallpaper Engine to another operating system is immense and it will also increase the costs of on-going maintenance work significantly, while the possible user group benefiting of this is comparatively tiny. We would much rather focus our time and energy on improving the Windows version for over 96% of Steam users.

However, we are keeping a close eye on the official Steam statistics and if the situation on Steam changes we are definitely open to look into figuring out how we could support more platforms in the future if it becomes viable.
