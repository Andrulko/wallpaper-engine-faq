The preview images are direct image downloads from the Steam servers. If the preview images are not loading, something is blocking the connection between Wallpaper Engine and the Steam servers. Some users had these blocks in their network router, you can test if this is an issue in your router or on your computer by testing if the preview images start showing up when your computer is connected to a wi-fi hotspot from your smartphone.
